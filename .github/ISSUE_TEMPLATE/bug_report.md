## Bug Details

### Bug Description
The SameerSweetyFolio Portfolio is experiencing the following issues:

1. **Responsive Layout Issue**: The portfolio does not adapt well to different screen sizes and devices. Some elements overlap or display incorrectly on smaller screens.

2. **Broken Links**: There are several broken links throughout the website. When clicking on certain navigation items or portfolio projects, users are not directed to the intended pages.

3. **Missing Images**: Some images in the portfolio section are not loading correctly, resulting in broken image placeholders or error messages.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: The portfolio has been tested primarily on Google Chrome but exhibits inconsistent behavior on other browsers such as Firefox and Safari. Certain features may not work as expected or display improperly on these browsers.

5. **Slow Loading Times**: The portfolio's load times are longer than expected, especially when accessing it for the first time. This could potentially impact user experience and discourage visitors from exploring the site further.

6. **Accessibility Issues**: The portfolio lacks proper accessibility features, making it difficult for individuals with disabilities to navigate and access content. It does not meet WCAG 2.0 standards for web accessibility.

7. **Typography Inconsistencies**: There are inconsistencies in typography across different sections of the portfolio. Font styles, sizes, and spacing need to be standardized for a more cohesive visual appearance.

### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce the issues mentioned above, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the SameerSweetyFolio Portfolio website at [bittobyte.tech](https://bittobyte.tech).

2. Click on various navigation links and portfolio project links, noting any broken or incorrect page redirections.

3. Observe the portfolio section for missing images or broken image placeholders.

4. Resize the browser window to smaller sizes and observe how the layout responds. Note any overlapping or incorrectly displayed elements.

5. Access the website using different web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Compare the behavior of each browser, specifically looking for inconsistencies in functionality and display.

6. Measure the initial loading time of the portfolio website and note any significant delays.

7. Use accessibility tools or screen reader software to navigate the website and identify any accessibility issues, such as improper labeling or lack of alternative text for images.

8. Compare the typography across different sections of the portfolio and note any inconsistencies in font styles, sizes, or spacing.

### Expected Behavior
Ideally, the SameerSweetyFolio Portfolio should exhibit the following behavior:

1. The responsive layout should adapt smoothly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that all elements are displayed correctly without overlapping or cutoff content.

2. All navigation links and portfolio project links should direct users to the intended pages without any broken or incorrect redirections.

3. Images in the portfolio section should load properly, without any broken image placeholders or error messages.

4. The portfolio should be compatible with major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring consistent functionality and display across these platforms.

5. The portfolio website should load quickly, providing a seamless user experience and reducing any noticeable delays during the initial page load.

6. The portfolio should incorporate proper accessibility features, adhering to WCAG 2.0 standards to ensure access and usability for individuals with disabilities.

7. Typography should be consistent throughout the portfolio, with standardized font styles, sizes, and spacing across different sections.
